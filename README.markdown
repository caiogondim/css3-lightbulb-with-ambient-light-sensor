# HTML5 Ambient Light Sensor

An experiment to use the new Ambient Light Sensor API.
When the enviroment is dark, the lamp will turn on.
When it's bright, it will turn off.

If you have a MacBook laptop, the light sensor is on your iSight camera.
Try to block it with your finger to simulate a dark enviroment.

The lamp is entirely built with CSS and, when the experiment was coded, worked
only on the latest Firefox.
